# Miragui Features

Miragui is an AI-driven, self-evolving dynamic GUI framework designed to revolutionize user interface development and interaction. Below is a detailed list of its core features and capabilities.

---

## 1. AI Features

### 1.1 Prompt-driven UI Generation
- Users can describe desired UI elements or behaviors using natural language prompts.
- Miragui interprets and dynamically generates or updates the GUI accordingly.
- Example: "Show a candlestick chart for AAPL in the main panel."

### 1.2 Self-evolving Interface
- The system learns from user interactions and adapts the UI over time.
- Personalizes the interface based on user behavior without manual intervention.

### 1.3 Intent Recognition
- Understands user goals beyond mere text input to generate appropriate UI responses.

### 1.4 Generative UI Components
- Creates new controls, widgets, or layouts dynamically using AI.
- Based on reusable templates defined by developers.

### 1.5 Real-time Dynamic Rendering
- Updates layout and UI components instantly without requiring application reloads.

## 2. Architecture & Developer Experience

### 2.1 Composable Widget Templates
- Supports high-level reusable widget templates that AI can instantiate or modify dynamically.

### 2.2 Declarative + Generative Hybrid Model
- Combines traditional declarative UI definitions with AI-generated components.
- Allows developers to control AI involvement levels.

### 2.3 Pluggable AI Backend
- Supports integration with various AI models or APIs (e.g., Maviena, GPT, Claude).

### 2.4 Live Development Mode
- Enables developers to write code and see AI-proposed UI changes in real time.

### 2.5 Undoable AI Actions
- Supports undo/rollback for AI-generated UI changes.

## 3. Cross-Platform Runtime

### 3.1 Native Cross-Platform Support
- Runs seamlessly on desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), web (WebAssembly), mobile (iOS, Android), and embedded systems.

### 3.2 Adaptive Layout Engine
- Automatically adjusts UI to device resolution, DPI, orientation, and user preferences.
- Supports dynamic themes such as dark/light mode.

---

## 4. Context Awareness

### 4.1 Session Memory
- Remembers recent user prompts and interactions to enhance UI adaptability.

### 4.2 Reactive Triggers
- Supports event-driven UI changes based on user actions or data changes.

---

## 5. Debugging & Observability

### 5.1 AI Interaction Logs
- Records prompts, AI decisions, and resulting UI states for debugging and auditing.

### 5.2 Live Visual Inspector
- Provides a real-time UI tree viewer with node state inspection and AI rationale explanations.

---

## 6. Extensibility

### 6.1 Plugin System
- Allows third-party plugins to add widgets, themes, actions, or data sources.

### 6.2 Custom Widget DSL (Optional)
- Supports custom domain-specific languages for widget definition and AI rule extensions.

---

## 7. Security & Sandbox

### 7.1 Prompt Guardrails
- Prevents malicious or harmful prompts from causing UI or system failures.

### 7.2 Widget Execution Sandbox
- Ensures AI-generated widgets cannot access system resources without explicit permissions.

---

## 8. Future-Ready Features

### 8.1 Offline AI Mode (Optional)
- Supports running AI models locally without internet connectivity.

### 8.2 Multimodal Prompt Support
- Accepts voice, image, or gesture input as prompts for UI generation.

### 8.3 Multi-Agent Collaboration
- Integrates multiple AI agents to collaboratively generate, test, or improve UI.
