# Miragui Vision

**Miragui** is the first AI-driven, self-evolving, dynamic GUI system designed to redefine how humans interact with software.

## Purpose

Traditional GUI frameworks require developers to manually define every component, layout, and event. In contrast, **Miragui** introduces a paradigm shift: users can describe what they want in natural language, and the GUI adapts itself accordingly â€” even in real-time.

Miragui is designed not just to render interfaces, but to *understand* the user's intent.

## Key Capabilities

* **AI-native interaction**
  Users can interact with the GUI using natural language prompts. The system interprets, generates, updates, and evolves the interface accordingly.

* **Self-evolving architecture**
  Miragui learns from past interactions and usage patterns to improve its adaptability and responsiveness. Over time, the UI evolves to fit the user's style and context.

* **Composable and extensible**
  Developers can define reusable "widget templates" that serve as high-level building blocks. These are dynamically instantiated or modified through AI.

* **Cross-platform support**
  Miragui runs seamlessly across desktop, web, embedded systems, and mobile devices.

* **Dynamic layout engine**
  The layout system adapts automatically to changes in device resolution, user preferences, or contextual needs.

* **Declarative by default, generative by design**
  While developers can define UI declaratively, Miragui is designed to generate and regenerate components autonomously in response to user goals.

## Our Philosophy

> The GUI is no longer a static artifact.
> It is a living, intelligent surface that evolves with the user.
